# About project

This project's aim is to achieve request batching to the openai gpt-3.5-turbo model and to present the output response of all requests as an array which can be looped through.


**I accidentally pushed the nodemodules folder along with the other files**


# How to run the program

1. Clone the repository
2. There might be no need to install any other packages because the nodemodule folder is already in the repo
3. CD to the directory of the repository after cloning or downloading it.
4. Get your openai api key and store in a **.env** file using the format in the `.env.example` file
4. Run `node .` to view the result.
